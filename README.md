The recipe is very similar to any other indo chinese noodles recipe with an extra flavour of chilli garlic flavour.
Once the ingredients are ready, the recipe for chilli garlic noodles can be prepared in less than 15 minutes without much fuss.
As the name suggests, chilli garlic noodles recipe is a bit on spicier side. but it would pleasantly surprise you with its sweet taste as well.
So basically it is an sweet and spicy combination noodles with a strong garlic flavour infused within the noodles.
This is my personal favorite noodles and I hope you guys like it too.
